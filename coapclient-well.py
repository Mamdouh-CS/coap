class Agent:
    """
    Example class which performs single GET request to coap.me
    port 5683 (official IANA assigned CoAP port), URI "test".
    Request is sent 1 second after initialization.

    Remote IP address is hardcoded - no DNS lookup is preformed.

    Method requestResource constructs the request message to
    remote endpoint. Then it sends the message using protocol.request().
    A deferred 'd' is returned from this operation.

    Deferred 'd' is fired internally by protocol, when complete response is received.

    Method printResponse is added as a callback to the deferred 'd'. This
    method's main purpose is to act upon received response (here it's simple print).
